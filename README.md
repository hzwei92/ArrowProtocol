# The Arrow Protocol

Each Arrow is basically a smart contract that defines a sourceURI and a targetURI.

Then we need 2 indexes to access the Arrows by sourceURI and targetURI.

This would enable the usage of smart contracts as intelligent links. 

See https://mindscape.pub/g/arrow-protocol for more details.
